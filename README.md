There is no such thing as a bad book. Even if a book has low ratings. I wanted to show how books, regardless of their rating can be considered worthy and beautiful. I used the Goodreads API to visualize the rating distribution of a book as a fractal tree. Books with lower ratings will be represented as smaller trees, but can still have super elaborate branches and colors, in the same way a book with lower ratings can still be life-changing and thoughtful.
